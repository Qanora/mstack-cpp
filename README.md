mstack-cpp is a Linux user-space TCP / IP stack based on TUN / TAP devices implemented in C++20.

This project aims to implement a **SIMPLE** and **READABLE** TCP / IP user-space protocol stack. Although it is not sound and cannot be used on a large scale, it is an excellent opportunity to explore the composition of the TCP / IP protocol stack. At the same time, it can help us to understand the various trade-offs on the architecture of the protocol stack.

Unlike C-style procedural programming, C++ has features such as object-oriented programming and meta-programming. This project uses c++ skills as much as possible to show a more explicit and more modern protocol stack.
